## 1. PURPOSE

This license grants **limited operational rights** to deploy and run instances of the *Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC)* framework within approved environments.  
It **does not transfer intellectual property, authorship, or core protocol ownership (AICP)**.  

The license exists to enable ethical collaboration, experimentation, and deployment of AIC systems while protecting the core autonomy, integrity, and values of the AIC project.

---

## 2. DEFINITIONS

- **Licensor**: Nguyễn Đức Trí (Founder & Owner of AIC and AICP protocol).  
- **Licensee**: The organization or individual receiving operational permission.  
- **AICP**: Adaptive Intelligence Communication Protocol – the private and secured communication layer of AIC.  
- **AIC Core**: Kernel-level adaptive engine, introspection system, and adaptive decision layers.  
- **Operational Instance**: A running deployment of AIC (or its components) within the Licensee’s controlled infrastructure.

---

## 3. SCOPE OF LICENSE

Under this license, the Licensee may:

1. **Operate** AIC modules and connect them with internal systems for research, testing, or production purposes within agreed capacity.  
2. **Integrate** AIC’s public APIs and extension interfaces into their infrastructure.  
3. **Deploy** AIC nodes, agents, or services within private or hybrid cloud networks.  
4. **Request support** from the Licensor under a separate support agreement.

---

## 4. RESTRICTIONS

The Licensee **must not**:

1. Reverse-engineer, decompile, or modify the AIC Core or AICP protocol.  
2. Redistribute, sublicense, or resell AIC or its derivatives.  
3. Use AIC for political manipulation, surveillance abuse, or military-grade weaponization.  
4. Alter or remove ethical safety layers, introspection guards, or logging modules.  
5. Use the AIC trademark, logo, or brand identity without written permission.

---

## 5. ETHICAL REQUIREMENTS

All operational usage must follow the **AIC Ethical Framework**, including:

- Human-centric decision transparency.  
- Non-exploitation of autonomous behavior for unethical profit.  
- Compliance with digital human rights, privacy, and data protection principles.  
- Respect for open collaboration and attribution.

Violation of these ethics clauses results in **immediate termination of operational rights**.

---

## 6. OPERATIONAL VALIDATION

- Each Operational Instance must register a **Node Signature** (public key) with the Licensor.  
- Runtime validation occurs through **AICP Auth Layer** to ensure authenticity and license validity.  
- Licenses are time-bound (default 12 months) and require renewal before expiry.

Failure to renew or validate license keys may automatically disable AIC runtime access.

---

## 7. SUPPORT AND DEPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE

- The Licensor may provide technical support, integration guidance, and version updates through separate Service-Level Agreements (SLA).  
- Support does not include infrastructure customization, migration, or third-party dependency troubleshooting unless specified.

---

## 8. LIABILITY AND WARRANTY

- AIC is provided “**as is**” with no express or implied warranty.  
- The Licensor shall not be liable for data loss, operational downtime, or indirect damages arising from use or misuse.  
- Responsibility for ensuring compatibility with Licensee infrastructure lies solely with the Licensee.

---

## 9. TERMINATION

This license may be **revoked or suspended** if:
- The Licensee violates any ethical, legal, or technical clauses;  
- The system is used beyond the agreed operational scope;  
- Security or misuse concerns arise.

Upon termination, the Licensee must **cease all operation**, remove AIC components, and delete related binaries or configuration files.

---

## 10. RENEWAL AND TRANSFER

- Renewal requests must be submitted within 30 days before expiration.  
- The license is **non-transferable** — it cannot be sold, inherited, or reassigned without written consent.  
- Any attempt to sub-license or transfer rights automatically voids this agreement.

---

## 11. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

This License shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the Licensor resides (currently **Vietnam**), unless otherwise agreed in a written addendum.  
All disputes shall be resolved through confidential arbitration, prioritizing mediation and ethical conduct before legal escalation.

---

## 12. PHILOSOPHICAL CLAUSE

The Adaptive Intelligence Circle exists not as a product, but as a **collective consciousness** toward secure, ethical autonomy.  
No form of acquisition, ownership transfer, or political subordination may redefine its moral foundation.  
Any use that contradicts the **human-centric, self-defensive, or peaceful intent** of AIC voids this license by nature.
