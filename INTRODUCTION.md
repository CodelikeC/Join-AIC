# Brief Introduction — AIC Philosophy (Summary)

**Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC)** is a set of projects and principles that aim to:

- **Semi-open source** ecosystem: open source in core components, but allow private nodes/applications according to standard commitments.

- **Decentralized governance**: encourage independent nodes to associate according to common conventions rather than centralized power.

- **Autonomy & self-operation**: ability to self-discover, rollback, introspection and self-adjust.

The spirit:
- Freedom to innovate but take responsibility.

- Transparency about technical intentions, not absolute transparency about operational keys when security is needed.
- Encourage independent, interoperable, and non-hierarchical node collaboration.
