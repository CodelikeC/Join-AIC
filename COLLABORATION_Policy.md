# **Adaptive Intelligence Circle – Collaboration Policy**

### Version: 1.0

**Last Updated:** November 2025

**Maintained by:** Nguyen Duc Tri (Founder, Architect)

## **1. Purpose**

This document defines the collaboration philosophy and operational boundaries of the **Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC)**.
AIC is not a conventional software project. It is a **technological and ethical movement** that seeks to explore **autonomous intelligence, adaptive architecture, and human-aligned ethics** in computation.

The purpose of this policy is to:

* Ensure that collaboration enhances — not dilutes — the AIC philosophy.
* Prevent misuse, political distortion, or commercial exploitation of AIC.
* Establish a **clear framework for semi-open, non-profit collaboration**.

---

## **2. Core Principles**

AIC operates on three foundational principles:

1. **Autonomy of Thought** – Every contribution must preserve the independence and reasoning depth of AIC.
2. **Ethics Before Power** – Technical capability without moral integrity is invalid within AIC.
3. **Transparency Without Vulnerability** – AIC remains open enough to inspire, but protected enough to survive.

---

## **3. Collaboration Model**

AIC follows a **Semi-Open Collaboration Model**, designed to balance openness and sovereignty.

| Layer                   | Access Level         | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Layer**          | Restricted           | Includes kernel logic, reasoning engine, protection modules, and self-adaptive mechanisms. Maintained exclusively by the founder or approved maintainers. |
| **Operational Modules** | Shared under license | Includes plugins, runtime utilities, simulators, or AI behaviors that can be reused by collaborators or partners under an AIC Non-Profit License.         |
| **Community Layer**     | Open contribution    | Documentation, educational content, or localization efforts are fully open for contribution with attribution.                                             |

## **4. Collaboration Criteria**

A collaboration or integration is only accepted if it meets **all** of the following criteria:

* **Non-Commercial Intent:** The partnership is not driven by direct commercial profit.
* **Ethical Alignment:** The partner agrees with AIC’s human-centered, transparent, and responsible AI philosophy.
* **Technical Integrity:** The partner must demonstrate technical maturity in distributed systems, security, or AI reasoning.
* **Political Neutrality:** AIC does not engage in collaborations that risk ideological manipulation, state censorship, or propaganda usage.
* **Respect for Ownership:** The AIC core and its identity remain under sole intellectual guardianship of its founder and maintainers.

---

## **5. Acceptable Forms of Collaboration**

✅ **Allowed:**

* Research co-development with academic or ethical research institutions.
* Integration of AIC modules (runtime, protection, simulation) into non-profit AI systems.
* Educational collaborations for open learning and technical outreach.
* Limited-term technical partnerships (e.g., security audits, language integrations) under clear NDA and license boundaries.

❌ **Not Allowed:**

* Forks that obscure the AIC name or violate its license boundaries.
* Modifications aiming at monetization, surveillance, or propaganda.
* Use of AIC code within closed-source military or political systems.
* Partnerships that compromise core ownership, authorship, or ethical stance.

---

## **6. Governance & Ownership**

AIC is owned, designed, and ethically guided by **Trí ND**, operating as an **independent, non-governmental, semi-open source initiative**.

Future governance may include:

* A **Circle Board**, composed of trusted maintainers and ethicists.
* A **Contributor Ethics Council**, to review sensitive pull requests or research proposals.

All ownership and copyright of the AIC Core remain under the Founder unless explicitly transferred under written consent.

---

## **7. Licensing & Usage**

AIC codebase may be released under **Apache 2.0**, **GNU GPLv3**, or **AIC Non-Profit License** depending on the component.
All external collaborations must comply with these terms.

A partner may **use or integrate** AIC modules only if:

* The integration acknowledges the source and philosophy of AIC.
* The result remains open or semi-open for educational or research benefit.
* No core alteration occurs without written consent.

---

## **8. Communication & Transparency**

Collaborators must maintain transparent communication through:

* Verified GitHub accounts or institutional email.
* Public issue discussions for technical changes.
* Private channels (encrypted) for sensitive core-related discussions.

Any hidden agenda, data misuse, or deviation from this policy will result in **immediate revocation of collaboration rights**.

---

## **9. Long-Term Vision**

AIC aims to:

* Become a **living proof** that advanced AI systems can evolve without financial capital, only with intellect, ethics, and persistence.
* Serve as a **humanitarian open intelligence circle** bridging engineers, philosophers, and artists.
* Inspire a generation of technologists who create with conscience.

Collaborations are therefore not just technical; they are **spiritual and ethical alliances**.
